# dat

"Decode" DAT files for "C-Control I" that contain scrambled assembly "system tokens" as generated by bpp.exe.

Unscrambled "system tokens" (usually 255) are ASCII integer decimals from "0"..."255" separated by space (" "), just like the "program data tokens".
The scrambled token string begins with "SCU " and is approximately twice as long as the unscrambled one. Each character from the original is XORed with a byte from a key string, the result is written as hex value (e.g. "3F"). Decoding is achieved by the reverse operation.
It appears that an additional 0 (zero) token is generated at the end.

The resulting cleartext tokens can be transferred to the CPU with a simple serial protocol (as with CCTrans32.exe, which handles both types of files.).

In essence, this frees you from having to use CCTrans32.
